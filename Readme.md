# Twido Backend

**Twido Backend** is the server-side component of the Twido application, designed to handle data processing, storage, and management for the Twido platform. It provides a robust API that supports functionalities such as user authentication, video uploading, and tweet management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine for building fast and scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store and manage application data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution to model application data.
- **CORS**: A middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing your backend to accept requests from the frontend application.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication and authorization.
- **dotenv**: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JWT.
- **Video Management**: API endpoints for uploading, retrieving, and managing videos.
- **Tweet Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete tweets.
- **CORS Support**: Allow requests from different origins for seamless integration with the frontend.
- **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables for sensitive configurations and API keys.

## üìö Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- npm (v6.x or higher) or yarn
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
